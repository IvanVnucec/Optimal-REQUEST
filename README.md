## About The Project
* Least-squares estimation of the attitude quaternion using vector measurements,  
* Recursive,  
* Suitable for Embedded systems,  
* Unit tested.  

## Built With
Project is built using [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) build system.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependancies `sudo ./scripts/install_deps.sh`
2. Build project `make build`
3. Run example `make run`

## Installation
TODO

## Usage
See [main.c](https://github.com/IvanVnucec/Optimal-REQUEST/blob/master/src/main.c) file for an example.

## Testing
See [test](https://github.com/IvanVnucec/Optimal-REQUEST/tree/master/test) folder.

## Matlab
The Optimal-REQUEST algorithm was firstly implemented in MATLAB. The implementation is located in the `matlab` directory.  
In the `matlab/misc` folder we have miscellaneous files which were used in the development of the algorithm. The explanation for every file is in their comment sections located at the top.  
In the `matlab/tests` folder we have files used to test the algorithm implemented in MATLAB and to generate artificial measurements for the testing of algorithm generated by the Matlab Coder in C language. In the `matlab/tests/figures` folder we are saving plots generated by the Maltab tests scripts.  
In the `matlab/utils` folder we have utilities scripts used in the algorithm itself. In every file there is an explanation.  
Other files in the `matlab` folder are used to invode the Matlab Coder and the main files for the algorithm itself.

## Documentation
In the [docs](docs) folder, there is a [document](docs/optimal_request_croatian.pdf) about development of the Optimal-REQUEST in Croatian language.
